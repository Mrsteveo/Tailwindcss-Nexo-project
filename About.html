            After seven-year management of Miss Eastlands, we are celebrating 8 years in the pageant and modeling
            industry. We’ve conducted in-depth research into the operations of five major pageants, paying particular
            attention to the needs of modern contestants. We discovered that for over a century, pageants have been
            running the same way: one king/queen gets all the attention and the other contestants are sent home, sad,
            crying and confused, their chapters are closed when the event ends. While most of the world’s pageants are
            continuing along a traditional path, today’s young contestants have changed. They are intelligent and
            results-oriented, they demand substance, and they don’t buy artifice. Pageant give Models and Actors a
            powerful platform to brand themselves, get noticed and use the pageant powerful marketing platform to excel
            in their carrier.

                female and male contestants. Here is your opportunity to participate in 2022 Competition.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 lg:text-base mt-5">Do you have what it takes to woo the ladies? Could you be the
                romantic lead in a feature Ad or the tough guy in an epic movie? Can you give People Magazine “Eastlands
                Thriving” a run for their money? If you can act, sing, dance, sell a product with your good looks or
                perhaps “walk a mean runway”, YOU are what we are looking for!</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 lg:text-base mt-5">We are in search of the man who can be a leading man in a
                romantic story, a public figure who can feature in a reality show, a world-class model who can grace the
                covers of magazines and a man who is involved in his community.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 lg:text-base mt-5">We are not looking for a bodybuilder (see requirements for a
                bodybuilder), we need a healthy athletic individual. A true gentleman with charisma and charm who can
                take the entertainment industry by storm and make Eastlands proud in the MISTER EASTLANDS® 2022
                competition.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 lg:text-base mt-5">Having a reputable title and a sash is a lot like having a
                business card or a golden key; it’s a way to get involved in the community or to speak for causes that
                need to be brought to the forefront.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 lg:text-base mt-5">If you are between the ages of 18-28, from any ward in
                Eastlands, single with no child, a “go getter”, a well-rounded man who feels you have what it takes get
                to the Eastlands competition, click APPLY NOW to reserve your spot for the EASTLANDS TITLE in the 2022
                competition with Finals on July 1st, 2022.

                organization uses to raise funds and support our charity causes. This is who we are and what MISS
                EASTLANDS ORGANIZATION stands for. Our pageant prides itself on its philanthropic focus, known to have
                raised funds for entrepreneurial and health causes bettering the lives of some of our Eastlands’ most
                vulnerable groups: underprivileged youth and young lactating mothers
                with special needs.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 text-base lg:text-lg mt-5">Contestant’s participation in the voting process is not
                only
                about winning the title but it’s also about giving back to the community by demonstrating your
                selflessness. This year for the first time a portion of the proceeds will be given to contestants so
                they can donate to the charities of their own choice.Therefore, it is very important to know that it is
                the responsibility of each and every contestant to contribute towards voting process.</p>
